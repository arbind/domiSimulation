Domi Simulation

The projects in this repo are test beds for incubating ideas
and developing out the domi system.

You can easily add new simulations to this repo.
Each new simulation can leverage work accomplished by prior simulations.

To create and integrate your new Simulation:

--- write your code
1. Develop your code (Domain object, service, biz logic, or util)

--- create a view controller
2. Create a new UIViewController Class with a xib file.
3. Name it coolIdeaSimilationViewController 
   (replaceing coolIdea with your cool idea :)
4. Have the interface (.h file) #import and extend iPadSimulationViewController instead of UIViewController
5. Move the files into Classes or Resources under HI/iPadUI

--- Define your View
6. open coolIdeaSimilationViewController.xib and add a UINavigationBar at the top of the view.
7. connect the navigationBar outlet from File's Owner to the toolbar you just added on the view.

--- Integrate your new view and controller into the app
8. in RootViewcontroller.m #import your coolIdeaSimilationViewController
9. in RootViewcontroller update: thenumberOfRowsInSection, cellForRowAtIndexPath and didSelectRowAtIndexPath
