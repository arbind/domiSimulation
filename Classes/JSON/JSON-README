This json framework code is from:
http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/

on NSString:
- (id)JSONValue; //converts a NSString to an NSDictionary or NSArray

on NSDictionary or NSArray:
- (NSString *)JSONRepresentation; // Returns a string containing a json representation;

in your objects (subclass of NSObject) override:
- (NSString *)JSONRepresentation;

(especially if your object is an item in a dictionary that is being converted to json)
